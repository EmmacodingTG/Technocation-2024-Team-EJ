# litter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Instructions:

To begin using our app, the user creates an account or logs in to a pre-existing one.

After logging in or signing up, the user then can view a map, their volunteer records (clock-like button), the instructions informing them how to use the app, and a list of parks with reported litter.

When they click on the map, they are able to search up locations to clean.

When they begin cleaning, they first read the disclaimer. Then, they take a before picture as a record of what the park looked like before cleaning.

After, they are able to begin cleaning, and their times are tracked using a stopwatch. To complete the cleaning process, they take a picture to compare with the before picture.

Finally, they can hand their cleaning report to their community sponsor, which includes the date, location, and amount of time spent cleaning. The community sponsor can verify their volunteer hours.

When they have completed the process, they can update the litter rating if it has gotten better after cleaning.

When they click on their records, it shows them all their volunteer records with the app. By clicking into each record, they can see the date, location, volunteered time, before picture, and after picture of the volunteer record.

When they click on the instructions, they can review how to use our app.

When they click on Find a Park, they are able to view a list of littered parks that people have reported. On that screen, they can add a park, edit a park, and delete a park.

For editing a park, the user must type in the name of the park on the top and the new rating on the bottom.

On the Find a Park page, the user can also copy the name of the park to paste into the search bar, to begin the cleaning process.
